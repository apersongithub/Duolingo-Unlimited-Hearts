Make into extension
see if variables work with older versions to ensure compaitibility (prob check diffs)
technically the app.js does not need modification you can just intercept user info
note: some of the js files arent loaded until later 
possible lite version
(there are three ways to get unlimited hearts now)

make a testing website to test js files / future proofing
