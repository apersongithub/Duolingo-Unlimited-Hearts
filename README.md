## Gist

> The following domains are accessed for patching Duolingo's web app. Each serves a specific purpose:

| **Data Access**                          | **Why?**                                                               | **Duolingo Server?** |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `duolingo.com`                          | Needed to modify the website or apply the patch                         | ✅ Yes               |
| `d35aaqx5ub95lt.cloudfront.net`         | Hosts the original unpatched `app-*.js`; must block requests to this    | ✅ Yes               |
| `raw.githubusercontent.com`             | Where the source of the patched `app-*.js` is located used to override the original          | ❌ No                |


## Installation Process

> [!NOTE]
> - I have uploaded it to [Mozilla Addon Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duolingo-unlimited-hearts/) — we are just awaiting review.
> - If we get some donations, I’ll be able to get a developer license and post it on the Chrome Web Store.

### General FAQ

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|--------------|------------|
| Why isn't this working!??11!! 😡 | Reload your page. |
| Does this follow TOS? | [In my opinion, yes](https://www.duolingo.com/guidelines#:~:text=Script%20or%20cheat,may%20be%20removed.). This is all on the client so there is no effect on the system. |
| Is this safe? | Yes, this script changes only **two lines** of code which are only responsible for hearts. |
| Is this all free? | Yes, but feel free to [support me](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/aperson). |
| How do I do this on my iPhone or Android device? | - There are plenty of modded APKs and IPAs out there that allow you to get premium for free. Do some research.<br>- Another option is using **Kiwi Browser** (Android) or **Orion Browser** (iPhone) to install the extension.|

### Developer FAQ

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|--------------|------------|
| Why is the modified `app-*.js` obfuscated? | The original `app-*.js` is obfuscated — there's nothing I can do. Everything else is open source. |
| Why is the modified `app-*.js` different from my personal one from Duolingo's servers? | Everyone's `app-*.js` is slightly different. I used mine so it stays consistent for everyone. |
| How can I reproduce this? | Contact me and I’ll show you. I don’t want this getting patched because I’m not maintaining it. |
| Why isn't the modified `app-*.js` in this repository? | Trying to avoid patches and honestly, I'm too lazy to change the URLs in the extension again. Its in a public repos-(You can find it easily if you're reading this anyways). |
| Why doesn't the extension just modify my personal `app-*.js` instead of using yours which could have a virus and secret code?!?! 😱 | Good question. That was considered, but I don’t know how to make that into an extension. Make a pull request if you want to try. This was just the easiest and most practical route.<br>Also, it's a **webpack chunk**, and I think it only works on sites with the webpack source map — i.e., only **duolingo.com**. Check the extension permissions too. This is **NOT** malicious. |
