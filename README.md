This took a day to figure out enjoy lol.


# What this script does 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **I probably wont maintain this**
> 
> - This script blocks a file on duolingo's server called app-*.js
> - In that file there is some local code that allows me to enable unlimited hearts
> - So what I do is replace it with a modified version which essentially patches it

# FAQ
### Normal FAQ:
- Will I get banned?
    - No.
- Is this safe?
    - Yes, this script changes only **two lines** of code which are only responsible for hearts.
### Dev FAQ:
- Why is the modified app-*.js obfuscated?
    - The original app-*.js is obfuscated there is nothing I can do about this. Everything else is open source.
- Why is the modified app-*.js different from my personal app-*.js from duolingo's servers?
    - Everyone's app-*.js is slightly different. I used mine so it stays the same for everyone.
- How can I reproduce this?
    - Contact me and I will show you I don't want this getting patched because I'm not maintaining this ðŸ’€.
