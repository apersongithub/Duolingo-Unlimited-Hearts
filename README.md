[**I probably wont maintain this**]


# Basics of what this extension does 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This script blocks a file on duolingo's server called app-*.js
> - In that file there is some local code that allows me to enable unlimited hearts
> - So what I do is replace it with a modified version which essentially patches it

# How to download

This just came out so I'm going to try to get it on the firefox extension store.

There are no prequistes all you need is the extension, no premium tier or school account required etc.

# FAQ
### Normal FAQ:
- Why isn't this working!11!! ðŸ˜¡
    - Reload your page..
- Will I get banned?
    - No.
- Is this safe?
    - Yes, this script changes only **two lines** of code which are only responsible for hearts.
- Is this all free?
    - Yes but you can support me but clicking on the extension.
- How do I do this on my iPhone or Android device?
    - There are plenty of modded APKs and IPAs out there that allows you to get premium for free. Do some reasearch.
    - Another option is using kiwi browser for android or orion browser for iphone to install the extension.
      - I haven't tested this and won't maintain it for those browsers if it works or not.
### Dev FAQ:
- Why is the modified app-*.js obfuscated?
    - The original app-*.js is obfuscated there is nothing I can do about this. Everything else is open source.
- Why is the modified app-*.js different from my personal app-*.js from duolingo's servers?
    - Everyone's app-*.js is slightly different. I used mine so it stays the same for everyone.
- How can I reproduce this?
    - Contact me and I will show you I don't want this getting patched because I'm not maintaining this ðŸ’€.
- Why is the modified app-*.js not in this repository.
    - Trying to keep things from getting patched and im too lazy to change the urls in the extension again. (you can find it easily).
- Why doesn't the extension just modify my personal app-*.js instead of using yours which could have a virus and secret code?!?!ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±
    - Good question, that was a thought but I don't know how to make that into an extension if you want to do it contact me. This was just the easiest and most practical route by just replacing it with my prebuilt one.
    - Also its a webpack chunk and i think it will only work on sites with the webpack source map aka duolingo.com + look at the extension permissions.


### This extension's required permissions for core functionality and why:

- Access your data for sites in the **duolingo.com** domain (Needed to modify the website/add the patch)

- Access your data for **d35aaqx5ub95lt.cloudfront.net** (This is where the unpatched app-*.js is hosted. Needed to block network requests from one specific file.)

- Access your data for **raw.githubusercontent.com** (Fetches the modified app-*.js to replace the unpatched one from the cloudfront server.)
