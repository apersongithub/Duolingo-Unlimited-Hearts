### General FAQ

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|--------------|------------|
| Why do I see a white screen and nothing else? | You are likely using an older version of the extension. If not, create an issue. |
| Does this follow TOS? | [In my opinion, yes](https://www.duolingo.com/guidelines#:~:text=Script%20or%20cheat,may%20be%20removed.). This is all on the client so there is no effect on the system. |
| Is this safe? | Yes, this extension is open source and only changes a few lines of code which are solely responsible for the paid features. |
| Is this all free? | Yes, but feel free to [support me](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apersongithub/Duolingo-Unlimited-Hearts/refs/heads/main/extras/donations.html). |
| Why do I still have Duolingo Max after uninstalling the extension? | This will only happen on **Firefox** because the patched files are cached temporarily. If you want it gone you would need to: clear your site data for duolingo.com, close all duolingo tabs, and log back in to duolingo in a new tab. You can also just wait until the site updates which brings me to my next point‚Äî‚ÄîI wouldn't recommend deleting the extension to use the cached version because when duolingo updates (about every week) the cached version won't work and it will be reverted to normal.|
| How do I know if the extension needs to update? | You can either click on the extension icon or just wait until it notifies you. It will show a popup with the version number. It will tell you if the extension requires updates or not based on a fetched version number from this respository. |
| How do I install the userscript. | Install the [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension and click [this](https://github.com/apersongithub/Duolingo-Unlimited-Hearts/raw/refs/heads/main/userscript/Duolingo%20Unlimited%20Hearts.user.js). Greasemonkey and others alike may also work. |
| Does this work if I have [energy](https://duolingo.fandom.com/wiki/Energy) and not hearts? | Energy is a mobile app only feature, go to the last question for more info. |
| How do I do this on my Apple (iPhone/iPad) or Android device? | - **Android**: You would first need to enable [Install unknown apps](https://www.wikihow.com/Allow-Apps-from-Unknown-Sources-on-Android) for the app you install the APK from. There are plenty of modded APKs available that unlock premium features. These can be found on various forums and third-party app stores. Do your research and be cautious about what you install.<br> Another option is using the **Firefox Browser**, which supports [imported extensions](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/09/29/expanded-extension-support-in-firefox-for-android-nightly/) similar to enabling developer mode on the desktop version of Chrome. This extension already has support for Firefox through the [Mozilla Add-ons Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duolingo-unlimited-hearts/) natively without debug mode. Other Android browsers that support extensions *may* also work.<br><br>- **Apple (iPhone/iPad)**: Modded IPAs do exist, but installing them requires **sideloading**, which means manually installing apps outside the App Store. This typically involves tools like [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/) **(Recommended)**, or a jailbroken device. If you plan on using SideStore I also recommend looking into [LiveContainer](https://github.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer) because of apple's sideloaded app limits. Do your research and be cautious about what you install. <br><br>*Although these steps are somewhat tedious, the ability to download a wide range of modded apps more than makes up for the work‚Äîwhether you're using an Android or Apple device. Think of the apps you use that have annoying ads or paywalled features...üëÄ*|

> [!Note]
> - This extension for the Safari Browser or any webkit browser AKA **(EVERY BROWSER ON iPhone/iPad)** will never be supported unless Apple fully implements `webRequest` or `declarativeNetRequest` APIs, which are necessary for this extension to function.  
>   - Even if the above happened, not only would I need to buy a **Mac** to develop it on Apple‚Äôs proprietary Xcode platform, I would also need to pay **$99/year** for a developer license to publish the extension on the App Store.  
>   - I *could* use a virtual machine, but I‚Äôd still have to pay for the license...


### Developer FAQ

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|--------------|------------|
| Why is the modified patched files minified/bundled? | The unpatched files are also minified because they are [webpack chunks](https://webpack.js.org/) ‚Äî there's nothing I can do. |
| How can I reproduce this? | Find your required webpack chunks/files then open '[duolingo patcher.html](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apersongithub/Duolingo-Unlimited-Hearts/refs/heads/main/extras/duolingo%20patcher.html)' and put it through. Then download the newly patched files and use firefox or chrome local overrides to point it towards the patched files you just downloaded. |
| Why aren't the modified patched files in this repository? | It is all done locally. It only fetches the github for the [extension-version.json](https://github.com/apersongithub/Duolingo-Unlimited-Hearts/blob/main/extension-version.json). |
| Why is the code slightly differen't for each browser? | Firefox and Chrome do not have equal extension support. I try my best to keep code parity between both browsers. |
| What happened to the chrome mv2 version of this extension? | I decided to remove it as major browsers don't support it anymore. |
| Will this always be open source? | Yes, this will **never** be closed source. |
| How does the userscript work? | It's very simple, the script intercepts your duolingo "account" json data file. It then finds and sets the unlimited hearts object to true. |
